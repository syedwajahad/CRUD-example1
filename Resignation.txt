Hi [Name],

Since today is my final day at [Company], I wanted to take a moment to tell you how much I’ve enjoyed my time here.

I’ve learned so much from your experience, advice, and guidance over the past [length of time], and my time spent as a [job title] on this team has been such a valuable part of my career journey. You’ve helped me [something your manager taught you, a skill they’ve helped you develop, or an opportunity they gave you]. I know I’ll carry the things I’ve learned with me to my next adventure, and I’ll always look back on this experience with a lot of fondness.

Even though our time working together is coming to a close, I’d still love to keep in touch. So please never hesitate to reach out to me at [personal email]!

Thanks so much, once again, for your leadership. Know that I’m always wishing the best to you and the [department] team!

Thanks for everything,

[Your Name]
